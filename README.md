# Graph DBMS Experiments

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks with personal experiments on various **graph database management systems (DBMS)**.
The goal is to explore how different graph databases work, compare their features, and document useful patterns, queries, and their integrations with Python and PySpark.

## ðŸ§ª Contents

- Hands-on experiments with popular graph DBMSs (e.g., Neo4j, Aerospike, Apache Age, Apache Hugegraph, etc.)
- Query language examples (Cypher, Gremlin, GSQL, SPARQL)
- Notes, findings, and comparisons between different tools

## ðŸ“š Disclaimer

These notebooks are intended for educational and experimental purposes.
They are not production-ready and may contain incomplete or evolving code and documentation.
