    "A Dgraph cluster consists of the following:\n",
    " * Dgraph Alpha database server nodes: The Dgraph Alpha server nodes in your deployment host and serve data. These nodes also host an /admin HTTP and gRPC endpoint that can be used for data and node administration tasks such as backup, export, draining, and shutdown.\n",
    " * Dgraph Zero management server nodes: The Dgraph Zero nodes in your deployment control the nodes in your Dgraph cluster. Dgraph Zero automatically moves data between different Dgraph Alpha instances based on the volume of data served by each Alpha instance."
